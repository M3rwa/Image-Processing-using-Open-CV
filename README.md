# Image Processing using OpenCV

This repository contains a project on image processing using OpenCV. The project focuses on various image processing techniques, including image enhancement, denoising, sharpening, morphological processing, and image segmentation. The project provides an implementation of these techniques using Python and the OpenCV library.

## Project Description

The Image Processing project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCV in manipulating and enhancing images. It covers a range of important image processing tasks to improve image quality, remove noise, sharpen details, perform morphological operations, and segment objects in images.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook (`Image Processing Project.ipynb`) provides a detailed guide to implementing different image processing techniques using OpenCV. It includes the following key sections:

1. Image Enhancement (Image Denoising): This section covers techniques to reduce noise and enhance image quality. It may include methods such as median filtering, bilateral filtering, or non-local means denoising.

2. Image Sharpening: The notebook explores techniques to sharpen images and enhance their details. It may cover methods like unsharp masking, high-pass filtering, or laplacian sharpening.

3. Morphological Processing: This section focuses on morphological operations to analyze and manipulate image shapes. It may cover operations like erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and morphological gradients.

4. Image Segmentation: The notebook demonstrates techniques to segment images and identify objects or regions of interest. It may cover methods like thresholding, region growing, or contour detection.

## Usage

To use the project notebook and apply image processing techniques:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the notebook (`Image Processing Project.ipynb`) directly.

2. Install the required dependencies, including Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the OpenCV library. You can use the following command to install OpenCV using pip:

   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook on your machine using the command `jupyter notebook`.

4. Open the notebook (`Image Processing Project.ipynb`) in your Jupyter Notebook interface.

5. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to execute the code cells and understand the implementation of various image processing techniques using OpenCV.

6. Modify and experiment with the code as desired to apply the techniques to your own images or explore additional image processing methods.


## Conclusion

The `Image Processing Project.ipynb` notebook in this repository showcases the implementation of various image processing techniques using OpenCV. By understanding the code and concepts presented in the notebook, you can gain insights into image enhancement, denoising, sharpening, morphological processing, and image segmentation. Feel free to apply these techniques to your own images or explore other image processing tasks using OpenCV.
